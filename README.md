# 2D-graphics-screensaver-on-LCD-interfaced-with-LPC1769
In this project, a graphic display prototype is developed using LPC 1769 interfaced with a 1.8‚Äù ST7735R TFT LCD. The aim is to display two screen savers namely rotating square patterns and randomized tree generation. The key in this project is to correctly understand and execute the concept of 2D pattern generation.
